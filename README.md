## What is Premiumize?

[Premiumize.me](https://www.premiumize.me/ref/995270975) is a all-in-one website which provides Torrent-, Filehoster- & Usenet Download Cloud, VPN, VoIP and Geo Unrestrict services at an acceptable price.

## What does the API do?

The API allows for automated Torrent Downloads and File Management, so this is what this PHP API allows you to do.

## How do I use it?

You just copy the `Premiumize.class.php` into your project folder, add your Customer ID and PIN, and finally:

```require "Premiumize.class.php";```

Take a look at [the example](https://github.com/timmyrs/Premiumize-PHP-API/blob/master/Example.php) if you struggle to find the functions based on the code.
